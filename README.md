# COS30049 - Computing Technology Innovation Project (CAA Flightforesight)

## File structure

The project folder is organized into two main subfolders: backend and flightforesight (frontend).

1. Backend: 
    - The `backend` folder is further divided into two main subfolders: `model` and `preprocessor`.
    - The `model` folder contains the backend logic for the web application, including the request processing files and three pre-trained Machine Learning models: `lgbm_regressor_delay.pkl`, `rf_regressor.pkl`, and `xgboost_tuned_model.pkl`.
    - The `preprocessor` folder has code for processing the input data received from the frontend input form.

2. flightforesight (frontend):
    - The `flightforesight` folder is structured as a standard React project, containing `src`, `public`, and `package.json`.
    - Additional files like `airlines.json`, `airports.json`, and `USA_airports.json` are included for user input validation and processing.
    - Inside the `src` folder, there are two subfolders: `assets` and `components`. The assets folder is used to store media files, such as images of team members, while the `components` folder contains the React components that form the frontend of the web application.

## Installation
### Flightforesight(Frontend) 

**Important Note**: Ensure that the terminal directory is strictly navigated to the right directory of `./COS30049-COMPUTING-TECHNOLOGY-INNOVATION-PROJECT_FLIGHTFORESIGHT/flightforesight` 

Run the following command to install all the required dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Backend

**Important Note**: Ensure that the terminal directory is strictly navigated to the right directory of `./COS30049-COMPUTING-TECHNOLOGY-INNOVATION-PROJECT_FLIGHTFORESIGHT/backend` 

Run the following command to install all the required dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

### Flightforesight (frontend)

**Important Note**: Ensure that the terminal directory is strictly navigated to the right directory of `./COS30049-COMPUTING-TECHNOLOGY-INNOVATION-PROJECT_FLIGHTFORESIGHT/flightforesight` 

To start the localhost server hosting the website frontend, run the following command

```
npm run dev
```

If successful, the server should be accessible in localhost

This URL will open the React application in your web browser, allowing you to interact with the frontend.


### Backend

**Important Note**: A new terminal is needed to run the backend concurrently with the frontend. Make sure that this terminal is strictly in the correct directory of `./COS30049-COMPUTING-TECHNOLOGY-INNOVATION-PROJECT_FLIGHTFORESIGHT/backend` 

Start the combined backend so both prediction APIs are available to the frontend:

```
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The Vite development server proxies `/api` requests to this backend. The combined app serves fare routes under `/api/fare/...` and delay routes under `/api/delay/...`.

## Vercel deployment

The root `vercel.json` defines two services: `backend` (FastAPI, rooted at `backend/`) and `frontend` (Vite, rooted at `frontend/`). Requests under `/api/` route to the backend; all other paths route to the frontend.

The prediction APIs use local SQLite databases by default. On Vercel, the fallback database files are placed in `/tmp`, which is writable but ephemeral and may not persist between function instances or deployments. Configure `DATABASE_URL` to use a managed database (and add its SQLAlchemy driver to `backend/requirements.txt`) if prediction history must persist.

The backend pins `xgboost-cpu` rather than the standard `xgboost` distribution. The delay classifier runs on CPU, and the CPU-only distribution avoids XGBoost's large Linux NCCL dependency, which can exceed Vercel's function bundle-size limit.

### Database
**Important Note**: A new terminal is needed to run the backend concurrently with the frontend. Make sure that this terminal is strictly in the correct directory of `./COS30049-COMPUTING-TECHNOLOGY-INNOVATION-PROJECT_FLIGHTFORESIGHT/backend` 
To be able to observe the database of the delay prediction and fare prediction, following these steps:
1. Install the DB browser for SQLite on https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/. Choose your suitable versions.
2. After installation is complete, open the app (it is called 'DB Browser for SQLite)
3. Choose 'Open Database' and browse for the created database (there are 2 database: fare_prediction.db for fare prediction and delay_prediction.db for delay prediction. 
Both databases are stored in the backend folder.)
4. After opening the database, you can view the tables and data in the database by choosing the 'Browse Data' tab and you could execute SQL commands on 'Execute SQL' tab.
This app is a high quality, visual, open source tool designed for people who want to create, search, and edit SQLite or SQLCipher database files. It works with Windows, macOS, and most versions of Linux and Unix.
